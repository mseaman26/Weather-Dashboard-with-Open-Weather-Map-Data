# Weather-Dashboard
This application displays current weather and a 5-day forecase for any city that the user enters. It keeps a displayed list of cities that the user has visited in the past, which is stored in local storage, allowing the user to see their personal list each time they visit the page.  The user can quickly toggle between cities from that list, add a new city, or clear the list.  The weather data comes from the openweathermap API.
